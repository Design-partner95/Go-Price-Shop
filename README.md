# Go-Price-Shop

# Introduction
Thank you for your interest in helping contribute to this project brought to you by DRM Web Design.  This project is to help the community so why not help the programming community as well.  First, I'll talk about the goals of the website and what it'll accomplish.  With your help, this may possibly just be the next best thing in the digital world if we all put our brain power together and work at going above and beyond with this project.

# What is the project?
Have you ever gone to a store and wish you had a way to know if you were getting the best price on that bundle of eggs?  On your favorite box of cereal?  Wouldn't it be amazing to have at your fingertips a way to put in your shopping list and it finds the store with the most savings.  There is so many different options out there that we simply just go to the store that is closest to us and pay whatever price.  If we could save just a bit more by going a few more miles down the road, the trip would be worth it.  

Also with that, each product that is input has all its ingredients loaded into a database and each ingredient is given a "Health Score" of A - F.  A+, A, A- etc.  With those grades, a point value is assigned to give you an overall "Health Score" on a product.  Each ingredient is researched and backed by a doctor's article found on the web for users to read about if they'd like.  In today's world, we have to watch what we eat as so many GMOs, artifical flavors, food colorings, and other ingredients that are incredibly dangerous are consumed and impacting your health.  

With these two options, we will also be able to do recipes and give them scores and recommend a store to go to buy the ingredients needed.

As you can see, this project is HUGE and can really be a game changer.

# Project Goals
- Security is number one.  No loop holes and no injections possible through queries, cookies, or sessions.  Make sure files are protected and information is secured.  Passwords, addresses, phone numbers, and emails all need to be secure.  SSL certificates are already in place on the domain.

- Users want everything to be as user-friendly as possible meaning less work for them makes a user happy.  Users do not want complex forms to fill out each time so as much data as we can get "automatically", the better.  Facebook implementation, Amazon Echo integration, and Google Home integration are some major branches for this project that will need to be researched and implemented into the project.  Obviously a mobile app will be needed as well.  Android and Apple applications with the newest technology and programming features.  

- With what has already been said, there is a lot to get done!  With your help, this can become a reality and something big!  Look forward in working with you all, learning together, and seeing what this becomes.  Good Luck and Happy Programming!
